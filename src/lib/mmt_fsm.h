 *
 * This is a simple finite fsm_state_struct machine implementation.
 * It supports grouped states, guarded transitions, events
 * with payload, entry and exit actions, transition actions and access to
 * user-defined state data from all actions.
 *
 * The user must build the state machine by linking together states and
 * transitions arrays with pointers.
 * A pointer to an initial state and an error state are given to fsm_init()
 * to initialize a machine object.
 *
 * The machine is run by passing events to it with the function fsm_handle_event().
 * The return value of the function will give an indication to what has happened.
