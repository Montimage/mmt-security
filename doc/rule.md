# 1. Sample rules

There are sample rules in [../rules/](../rules/)


# 2. Embedded functions

Embedded functions are functions that allow implementing calculations 
that are too complicated to define using only classical operators on fields in the Boolean expressions of security rules. 
One can either use existing embedded functions or implement a new function. 
In both cases, they can be used in the Boolean expressions by using the syntax:

  `#<name_of_function>(<list of parameters>)`

For example:

  `(#em_is_search_engine( http.user_agent ) == true)`
   
where `http` is the protocol name and `user_agent` is the attribute name (i.e., packet meta-data).

**To avoid any confusion**, a new embedded function name should start by a prefix `em_`.

## 2.1. Special terms

1. `true` will be replaced by the number 1. For example 

  `#em_check( tcp.src_port ) == true`

2. `false` will be replaced by the number 0. For example 

  `#em_check( tcp.src_port ) == false`


## 2.2 Implement a new embedded function
In each rule file, there exists a section allowing user to add an embedded function.

```xml
<embedded_functions><![CDATA[
//code C
static inline bool em_check( double port ){
   if( port == 80 || port == 8080 )
      return true;
   return false;
}
]]></embedded_functions>
```

In side this tag, one can also implement 2 other functions as the followings:

1. `void on_load(){ ... }` being called when the rules inside the xml file being loaded into MMT-Security

2. `void on_unload(){ ... }` being called when exiting MMT-Security


## 2.3 Pre-installed embedded functions

In boolean expressions of rules, one can use one or many embedded functions

1. `is_exist( proto.att )`  checks whether an event has an attribute of a protocol, e.g., `is_exist( http.method )` will return `true` if the current event contains protocol `HTTP` and attribute method has a non-null value, otherwise it will return `false`.

	Normally MMT has a filter that allow an event in a rule to be verified only if any proto.att used in its boolean expression contains value. If one of them has not, the rule will not be verified. This allows to reduce number of verification of boolean expression, thus increases the performance.
	
	For example, given an event having the following boolean expression:
	
	`((ip.src != ip.dst) && (#em_check_URI(http.uri) == 1))`
	
	This event is verified only if `ip.src` and `ip.dst` and `http.uri` are not null, hence only HTTP packets are verified (it does not verify every IP packets).
	
	However, if one use the following expression, that is totally having the same meaning with the previous one:
	
	`((ip.src != ip.dst) && ((#is_exist(http.uri) == true ) && (#em_check_URI(http.uri) == 1)))`
	
	MMT need to verify the expression against any IP packet as `is_exist` tell MMT to exclude `http.uri` from its filter.
	

2. `is_empty( proto.att )`, e.g., `is_empty(http.uri)` checks whether the string value is empty, i.e., its length is zero.

3. User can use any standard C functions as embedded function, e.g., `(#strstr( http.user_agent, 'robot') != 0)` to check if `http.user_agent` contains a sub-string `"robot"`.

   Please note that, before using a C function the library containing that embedded functions need to be included.
   The following libraries have been pre-included:
   
```C
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "mmt_lib.h"
#include "pre_embedded_functions.h"
```

   Thus when using a function that does not defined inside these libraries, one need to include its library. For example:
   
```xml
<embedded_functions><![CDATA[
#include <math.h>

static inline bool function em_check( double port ){
    double x = sqrt( port );
    ...
}
]]></embedded_functions>
```
   
# 3. Reactive functions
   
Reactive functions allow user perform some action when a rule is satisfied.
The functions will be called each time their rules are satisfied. 
When a security and attack rules are satisfied, they will give `not_respected` and `detected` verdicts respectively.

To implement and use a reactive function, one need:

- implement a C function inside `embedded_functions` tag. The function name should be prefixed by `em_` to avoid any confusion with the ones existing in MMT.

  The function has the following format:

```C
typedef void (*mmt_rule_satisfied_callback)(
		const rule_t *rule,		          //rule being validated
		int verdict,                     //DETECTED, NOT_RESPECTED
		uint64_t timestamp,              //moment (by time) the rule is validated
		uint64_t counter,                //moment (by order of message) the rule is validated
		const mmt_array_t * const trace  //historic of messages that validates the rule
);
```
   
- put the function name in attribute `if_satisfied` of the rule you want to react. For example: `if_satisfied="em_print_out"`


```xml
<beginning>
<embedded_functions><![CDATA[
static void em_print_out(
      const rule_info_t *rule, int verdict, uint64_t timestamp, 
      uint64_t counter, const mmt_array_t * const trace ){
   const char* trace_str = mmt_convert_execution_trace_to_json_string( trace, rule );
   printf( "detect rule %d\n%s\n", rule->id, trace_str );
   //you can call a system command, for example:
   //char command[1001];
   //snprintf( command, 1000, "echo rule %d is validated by %s", rule->id, trace_str );
   //system( command );
}
]]></embedded_functions>

<!-- Property 10: HTTP using a port different from 80 and 8080.-->
<property value="THEN" delay_units="s" delay_min="0" delay_max="0" property_id="10" type_property="EVASION" 
    description="HTTP using a port different from 80 and 8080." if_satisfied="em_print_out">
    <event value="COMPUTE" event_id="1" 
        description="HTTP packet using a port different from 80 and 8080"
           boolean_expression="((http.method != '')&amp;&amp;((tcp.dest_port != 80)&amp;&amp;(tcp.dest_port != 8080)))"/>
    <event value="COMPUTE" event_id="2" 
           description="HTTP packet"
           boolean_expression="(ip.src != ip.dst)"/>
</property>
</beginning>
```

# 4. Compile rules

MMT-Security rules are specified in plain text following a XML format.
These rules need to be encoded in a suitable format, that is a dynamic C library, before being able to use by MMT-Security.

The compiled rules must put in either `./rules` or `/opt/mmt/security/rules`.
The former has higher priority and only one of them will be taken into account by MMT-Security.
Specifically, if MMT-Security found `./rules` folder in the current folder executing, it will use the rules inside this folder and
it does not take into account the rules in `/opt/mmt/security/rules`.

## 4.1 Compile rules
MMT-Security provides a compiler to do the such of task. Its source code is in [`src/main_gen_plugin.c`](../src/main_gen_plugin.c) file.

- use `make compile_rule` to compile this program to get an executable program `compile_rule`

- use `compile_rule` to compile rules in a XML file. For example:

   `./compile_rule rules/1.so rules/1.ssh.xml`
   
   The program uses 3 parameters in form: `./compile_rule output_file property_file "[gcc parameters]"`

   where:

   - `output_file`: is the path of file containing the result that can be either a .c file or .so file.
   - `property_file`: is the path where the property file can be found.
   - `options`: 
      
      - `-c`: will generate only the C code. This option allows manually modifying the generated code before compiling it. 
       After generating the C code, the tool prints out the command that needs to be executed for compiling it.
       
       - gcc parameters: used to generate the C code, and compile it to obtain the .so file.
                      These parameters will be directly transmitted to the gcc compiler, for example, `"-I /tmp -lmath"`
       
Please note that, the compiled rules must be put in the directory `./rules` or `/opt/mmt/security/rules/`

## 4.2 Obtain information inside compiled rules 

To get some basic information about a compiled rule (such as, ID, description) MMT provides a tool:
[`src/main_plugin_info.c`](../src/main_plugin_info.c)

- use `make rule_info` to obtain its executable program
- use `./rule_info` to print information of all compiled rules in `./rules` or `/opt/mmt/security/rules/`

   By default, the tool will print out the information on all rules, for example:
   
```
./rule_info 
Found 37 rules.
1 - Rule id: 1
	- type            : attack
	- events_count    : 4
	- variables_count : 5
	- variables       : ip.dst (178.13), ip.src (178.12), tcp.dest_port (354.2), tcp.flags (354.6), tcp.src_port (354.1)
	- description     : Several attempts to connect via ssh (brute force attack). Source address is either infected machine or attacker (no spoofing is possible).
	- if_satisfied    : (nil)
	- version         : 1.1.5 (70a367f - 2017-6-8 12:42:25), dpi version 1.6.8.0 (b3e727b)
2 - Rule id: 10
	- type            : evasion
	- events_count    : 2
   ...
...
```

- The tool can also be used to inspect a specific compiled rule by giving the rule path as parameter, for example:

```
./rule_info /opt/mmt/security/rules/4.arp.so 
Found 1 rule.
1 - Rule id: 4
	- type            : attack
	- events_count    : 3
	- variables_count : 7
	- variables       : arp.ar_op (30.5), arp.ar_sha (30.6), arp.ar_sip (30.7), arp.ar_tip (30.9), ethernet.dst (99.2), ethernet.packet_count (99.4099), ethernet.src (99.3)
	- description     : IPv4 address conflict detection (RFC5227). Possible arp poisoning.
	- if_satisfied    : (nil)
	- version         : 1.1.5 (70a367f - 2017-6-8 12:42:28), dpi version 1.6.8.0 (b3e727b)
```
 
# 5. Default values

In the XML file of a rule, if an attribute is absent then its value is set by default:

- `property`, `operator`:
   + `value` : `COMPUTE` (=> only one `<event>` is required. Thus `delay_min` and `delay_max` must be 0)
   + `delay_units`: `s`
   + `delay_min`: 0
   + `delay_max`: 0
   
An example of `COMPUTE`rule:

```XML
<property property_id="11" type_property="EVASION" 
    description="IP packet size incorrect">
    <event value="COMPUTE" event_id="1" 
           description="Packet size incorrect"
           boolean_expression="((meta.packet_len &lt; 34)"/>
</property>
```

 
# 6. Write a high performance rule
 
 To write a rule having a high performance one need to:
 
 - use only the proto.att in boolean expression when need. 

   - Please refer to the usage of function `is_exist` in section 2.3 to get an example.
   - Use explicitly the following tcp flags to filter out unwanted verification: tcp.fin, tcp.syn, tcp.rst, tcp.psh, tcp.ack, tcp.urg, tcp.ece, tcp.cwr.
  		
  	  For example, the 2 following boolean expressions have the same meaning:
  		
    `(tcp.flags == 4)` and `((tcp.flags == 4) && (tcp.rst == 1))`
  		
  	  They both return `true` when only RST flag of a TCP packet is on, but the latter is better as MMT verifies its rule only when `tcp.flags` and `tcp.rst` are not zero. Usually less than about 1% packets having `tcp.rst != 0`, consequently the rule using the second expression will be verified against only 1% packets.

 - reduce `delay_max` of a rule to a suitable value. 

 	When having a higher value of `delay_max` MMT-Security creates more rule instances to correlate different events of different packets. When `delay_max` is zero, the rule is call simple rule, MMT-Security verifies the rule and gives verdict immediately without creating any rule instances. A simple rule is verified much faster than a complex one that has non-zero `delay_max`.
 	
 	At 10Gbps, MMT-Security can verify 12400 simple rules or 600 complex rules.
 
 - optimize implementation of embedded functions.

	 - The embedded functions are called each time their boolean expressions are verified. Consequently, rather than initialize something, for example, connection to database, inside these functions, one can do such a task, only once, inside function `on_load` then store the connection into a static local variable that will be used inside the embedded functions.
	
	 - alway use embedded function with `static inline` keyword. For more information about advantage of `inline`, please refer to document of gcc: [An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html)
