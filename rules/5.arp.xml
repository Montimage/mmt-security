<!-- These properties analyse ARP messages using the following packet fields:
        ar_op  : ARP OPCODE field that identifies if it is a REQUEST (value 1) or a REPLY (value 2)
        ar_sip : Sender IP address (IP address of the device sending the ARP message)
        ar_tip : Target IP address (IP address of the target device)
        ar_sha : Sender MAC address (MAC address of the sender device)

     Note that these properties detect possible attacks. There are cases where they are not, such as when one needs to:
        change a device and reuse the same IP address,
        change the MAC address of a device.
-->
<!-- Property 5: Two ARP replies that should provide the same MAC address are different. This rule is simpler than Property 1 
                 above and detects the same potential attacks without generating a message for each combination of request-reply.
-->
