<!-- Property 20: C4_Analyse_04i: ICMP redirect flood detection-->
<!-- Depending on OS implementation, these host based routes can have the characteristic of being short lived.  
Solaris implements aggressive aging where redirects will only last for a specified amount of time.  
Each redirect is given a short lifetime value and will be automatically removed from the routing table when the timer expires.   
This is to ensure that redirects do not remain the routing table indefinitely at the risk of further sub optimal routing.  
In BSD networking code, redirects will be removed if they are being used by TCP and only after the fourth consecutive retransmission attempt.  
Routed and Gated perform similar forms of redirect expiration.  
Since ICMP redirects are dynamic and may not reflect the most current topology 
it is nice to have an automated method of redirect expiration.
